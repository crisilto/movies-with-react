# Vidly - Movies with React

First project with React through the Create React application.

It is a video library that allows :
- User registration and login.
- Searching for movies within a fake database.
- Creating new movies, liking and sorting them...
All from a frontend approach.

I have been improving the code, refactoring it and bringing it into line with the most current practices.


**Pending improvements.**
**Deployment:** [Vidly](movies-with-react-phi.vercel.app/)
